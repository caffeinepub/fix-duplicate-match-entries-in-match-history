Both REQ-6 (Reset Current Match UI action) and REQ-7 (ensuring reset is local-only and doesn't affect backend) are completely missing from the implementation.",

      "requirement": "Add a 'Reset Current Match' action in the frontend that clears all in-progress match state (scores, wickets, overs, players, bowlers, innings data) managed by frontend/src/contexts/MatchContext.tsx, returning the scorer to the initial 'no active match' state without affecting saved match history in the backend",
      "reason": "No changes to MatchContext.tsx, Header component, ScoringPanel, or any frontend component that would implement the reset action. Only project_state.json was modified, which is a metadata file",

      "requirement": "Ensure that resetting the current match does not trigger any backend mutations or affect stored match history, and verify that the user can immediately start a new match after reset without encountering state conflicts or validation errors",
      "reason": "No implementation of reset functionality exists in the diff, so verification requirements cannot be met. No changes to MatchContext or any frontend logic",
