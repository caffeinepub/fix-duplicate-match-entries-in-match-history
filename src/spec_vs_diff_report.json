  "summary": "Diff adds a frontend-only deployment diagnostics UI (dialog + hook + error parser) that can classify errors as build vs deploy and display/copy details, but it does not show evidence of actually retrying/executing a new build+deploy attempt or surfacing actionable failure output to the developer/operator running the deployment pipeline.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-5",
      "requirement": "Retry the application build and deployment process that previously failed (execute a new build + deploy attempt).",
      "reason": "All changes shown are frontend React components/hooks/utilities. There is no evidence of changes to build/deploy scripts, CI/CD configuration, or deployment tooling that would trigger or implement a new build+deploy attempt.",

      "reason": "The diff implements client-side parsing/display of an error string (via query params/localStorage) but does not show evidence that the actual deployment process emits/prints this information in the deployment logs/output or that the failing step is captured from real build/deploy execution.",
